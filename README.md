# HR-Data-Analytics Project

# Overview
This end-to-end data analytics project focuses on analyzing a real 
employee presence dataset from AtliQ Technologies. The primary objective 
is to provide actionable insights to the HR department through a Power BI 
dashboard, aiding in decision-making related to employee attendance and 
presence.

# Project Summary

In this project, we worked with a dataset containing employee attendance records from AtliQ Technologies for the period of 2022-2023. An HR representative from AtliQ conveyed their requirements, and based on these, we developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides insights into various employee metrics, which are crucial for the HR department’s strategic planning.

# Dataset

Name: Attendance Sheet 2022-2023
Source: AtliQ Technologies
Description: The dataset includes detailed records of employee attendance over a one-year period. It has been anonymized to protect employee privacy.

# Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
Excel: For data cleaning and preparation (if applicable).
Python (optional): Any additional data preprocessing steps can be done using Python.

# Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard includes the following features:

Employee Attendance Overview: A high-level view of overall employee attendance, including total days present, absent, and late.
Monthly Attendance Breakdown: A detailed breakdown of attendance on a monthly basis, helping HR identify trends over time.
Department-wise Analysis: Insights into attendance patterns across different departments.
Employee Performance Metrics: KPIs related to individual employee attendance performance.
Custom Filters: Interactive filters allowing HR to drill down into specific departments, time periods, and employee details.

# How to Use the Dashboard

Open the Power BI file: Load the HR Data Analytics.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
Explore the Dashboard: Navigate through the different pages of the dashboard to explore the various insights provided.
Apply Filters: Use the available filters to narrow down the data according to specific needs (e.g., by department, month, or employee).
Export Reports: The dashboard allows you to export the visualizations and data for further reporting or presentations.

# Key Insights

Some of the key insights derived from the dashboard include:

Patterns in employee attendance that might indicate potential issues.
Departments with consistently high or low attendance rates.
Identification of employees who might need attention based on their attendance records.

# Conclusion

This project showcases the power of data analytics in providing meaningful insights from real-world datasets. By leveraging Power BI, we were able to create a user-friendly dashboard that meets the specific needs of AtliQ Technologies’ HR department. This project is a valuable addition to any data analyst’s portfolio, demonstrating the ability to work with real data and deliver actionable business intelligence solutions.
